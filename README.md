I Want to illustrate an AI-driven solution for navigating mazes

Overview:

Maze Solver is a Python program that reads a maze from a text file and finds the shortest path from the start point (A) to the goal (B) using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The program provides visual feedback of the solution and explored states, and saves an image of the maze with the solution path highlighted.

Features:

Maze representation with walls, start (A), and goal (B)
Exploration tracking to avoid loops
Solution visualization with highlighted path
Image output for the maze and solution
Simple command-line interface
Customization options for displaying explored paths and saving images

Technical Details:

Language: Python
Dependencies: Pillow (PIL) for image generation

To install the required dependencies,on your command-line run:
pip install pillow

Performance: Efficient pathfinding with minimal memory usage
